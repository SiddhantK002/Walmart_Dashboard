FINDINGS:
 
By observing 5.2.4 Analysis for EMEA Market following conclusion and patterns are formed:
The exploratory data analysis of Walmart's retail data spanning 2019 to 2022 revealed a notable trend. Among the major markets, including Africa, APAC, Canada, EMES, EU, LATHAM, US, and EMEA, it was consistently observed that EMEA was the only market experiencing quarterly losses in at least one quarter each year from 2019 to 2021. In contrast, all other markets, including Africa, APAC, Canada, EMES, EU, LATHAM, and US, demonstrated steady growth in both sales and profits throughout this period. This finding underscores the need for targeted strategies in the EMEA market to address the recurring losses and emphasizes the overall positive trajectory of Walmart's retail operations in most other regions.
